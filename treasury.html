                <h1>US Treasury Redesign</h1>
                <p>
                    The current website for the US Treasury is outdated, and overwhelms users with information. My team and I set out to redesign it, 
                    making it easier to digest information, and allowing users to more easily find what they need.
                </p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>
                        Starting off with research, we did a heuristic evaluation. It helped us pinpoint many areas in need of improvement throughout 
                        the Treasury website. We specifically found the volume of information overwhelming, and the user paths to be inconsistent. After 
                        doing a heuristic evaluation, we created a mood board to help us understand the general feel of the Treasury and guide us with 
                        the style of the redesign. Money is the biggest theme on the board since the Treasury is all about maintaining the economy and 
                        financial security of the US.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step was doing usability testing on the current site. We conducted six tests to determine the ease of use, visual 
                        appeal, and readability of the US Department of the Treasury website. Most of the testers were able to complete the tasks, but 
                        there was a lot of clicking around and uncertainty.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Definition & Ideation</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>
                        Taking our findings from the usability tests, we created an affinity diagram which we distilled further into an empathy map. We 
                        found that our proto-persona Jordan wants to know the interest rates and keep up with the current market, but gets overwhelmed by 
                        the information on the site. This allowed us to create our final persona Jordan Martines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After finding that Jordan was overwhelmed by information, we decided to run more user tests focusing specifically on the 
                        navigation. We hypothesized that it was a major contributor to the information overload. From the tests, we confirmed that users 
                        were unable to digest the information in the navigation menus.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At this point, we knew there was a problem with the way the information in the navigation menu was structured. Through card sorting, 
                        we found that the way the information was presented in one big menu made parsing it difficult. We then built a sitemap to figure out 
                        how we might break down the information into more digestible chunks.

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>
                        Using the sitemap, we created a prototype for the new navigation. We decided to design three levels for the navigation and nested 
                        the third level items into their respective second level categories. We also experimented with different color schemes and typography.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/treasury/Navigation Wireframe.png" alt="Navigation Wireframe">
                    <p>
                        Moving on to the homepage, we started with the original and considered how we might improve upon the layout and built a low-fi 
                        wireframe. We decided that certain items were more important to Jordan based on our findings, so we moved the Tools and Data Center 
                        sections up to be more accessible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using our wireframe, we built a prototype for both the desktop version, and the mobile version. We took great care to make something 
                        that was representative of the US Treasury and easier for Jordan to use. Our most significant addition was a graph that allows Jordan 
                        to view historical data for the Interest Rate Statistics. We also changed the Tools section to buttons and moved them just below the 
                        hero space.
                    </p>

            <section>
                <div class="sectionHeader">
                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>
                        Once we were done prototyping, we moved on to Testing. We started with 5 second tests. We concluded that the decisions taken to change 
                        the Data Center to Interest Rate Statistics with a visual graph and update the Tools section made our users more engaged. One user said, 
                        "Very visual and open--lots of space and pictures. It's not too cramped, and Buttons are large and user friendly. I like the colors and 
                        the data graph. It seems readable - like a quick read."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the 5 second tests, we did one last round of usability testing. We found that our navigation was much easier to use than the 
                        original, with a 100% success rate on our task of locating the option to buy bonds. For switching between graph and dataset view, users 
                        had a 50% success rate. In response, we changed the icons to make them more visible.

                        During the process of redesigning the website for the U.S. Treasury, we were able to build a more updated design that's easier to use. 
                        By restructuring the navigation and reorganizing the homepage to better suit users needs, our design reduces unnecessary friction.
                        In the future, we would like to redesign some of the other pages on the website and smooth out some wrinkles in the current design. 
                        The News page could be improved with search filters and categories, or maybe some kind of tagging system, and the Interest Rate 
                        Statistics page could be improved to better present available data, though more research would be required.
