                <h1>SLAM Redesign</h1>
                <p>
                    Salt Lake Academy of Music is a non-profit based in Utah that provides after-school lessons, performance,
                    composition, songwriting, recording, and summer camp programs for K-12 kids of
                    all backgrounds, and skill levels. When looking at their website, I knew that it needed to be redesigned.
                    It was very cluttered and finding information about things like classes and instructors was very difficult.
                    During the process of redesigning the website, my team and I made it much cleaner and made it responsive.

                    <p>
                        Starting out, we needed to figure out who we were designing for, so we made a proto-persona in order
                        to better understand who the user would be. It was obvious that it would either be a kid who is
                        interested in learning music, or a parent of said kid. We decided to focus on the parent for this 
                        redesign.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step was conducting user interviews, selecting for parents of children who were interested in
                        music. Our questions focused on what they would look for in a music school, and what was most important
                        for their children's musical education. After the interviews, we organized the results with an affinity
                        map in order to better understand our findings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also did a heuristic evaluation on the original website. There was a lot of clutter, and some of the
                        navigation items went to the same page. We knew that the SLAM website was cluttered but by doing the 
                        heuristic evaluation we were able to figure out just how bad it was.
                    </p>

            <section>
                <div class="sectionHeader">
                    <h3>Definition & Ideation</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>
                        From our work so far, we found that SLAM's website is busy, cluttered, and
                        inconsistent, which makes it difficult for parents interested in enrolling their
                        children to find information and make a decision. We hypothesized that by
                        cutting out inconsistencies and condensing the layout of the site to mainly
                        present information that's relevant to these users, it would make the site
                        easier to read and navigate, therefore making it easier for parents to find the
                        information they need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the navigation, we knew that we needed to create a new site map. It allowed 
                        us to organize and structure the content and features of the website in a logical 
                        and intuitive manner. We carefully considered Audrey's motivations, ensuring that 
                        the site map aligned with her goals of finding suitable music programs for her 
                        children and understanding the advantages of choosing SLAM. This allowed us to 
                        simplify and declutter the navigation.

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>
                        Before designing a prototype, we created a style 
                        guide that we could base our visuals off of. 
                        Overall we kept most of the colors that Slam
                        already had because we wanted to create
                        consistency and cohesion in the brand's
                        visual identity across the website. The
                        original website used quite a few different
                        fonts, so we chose to use Nunito Sans for
                        headers and Open Sans for body text in
                        order to keep text consistent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moving on, we created a mid-fi prototype, which served as an essential tool for validating 
                        our design decisions, incorporating user feedback, and fine-tuning the user experience.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section>
                <div class="sectionHeader">
                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>
                        Once we had finished our mid-fi prototype, we could move on to testing. The tasks that we 
                        tested were filling out and submitting a contact form, and viewing instructors. From the 
                        tests we realized that by putting instructors in the About page, it was more difficult 
                        for users to find. We decided that it would be best to move the instructors to the lessons 
                        page because most of the testers went to that page when looking for them.

                    <p>Through this experience, I reinstilled the importance of having a
                        good website design that not only attracts users but also instills
                        confidence in your product. A well-designed website can make all the
                        difference in creating a positive user experience and building trust with
                        your audience.</p>
