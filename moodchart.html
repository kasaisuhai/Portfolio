                    I had the idea for this project because I'm interested in things like journaling and meditating, and I knew that this could be very 
                    helpful for a lot of people because so many of us just go through life unaware of what we're feeling. My team and I created 
                    MoodChart.me because we wanted to help our users keep track of their overall mood. Moods can last for hours while emotions last 
                    anywhere from seconds to minutes, at most. This is why it's typically easier to identify emotional triggers but difficult to 
                    identify triggers for moods.

                        Starting off we created a proto-persona to get an idea of who our user would be. We knew our user would be someone who is either 
                        mental health conscious, or someone with a mood disorder such as Bipolar Disorder, Depression, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After getting an idea of who our user is, we created a survey. We mainly wanted to find out how aware people are of their moods 
                        and what other factors might be correlated to said moods. We also asked about average amount of sleep and energy levels. We found 
                        that 50.1% of respondents rated awareness of mood as 6 or less, 31.3% described their overall mood as anxious, 62.6 rated their 
                        energy level as 6 or less, and 25% reported sleeping less than 6 hours on average.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our next piece of research was a competitor analysis. We decided to analyze two competitors, eMoodTracker and MoodTracker. With 
                        eMoodTracker, their design was outdated and they had limited features. One of their biggest strengths were safety features that 
                        protected their users important data and ensured it isn't misused. As for MoodTracker, their design was also outdated and they 
                        didn't cater to a broad range of users. Their strengths were allowing users to share their data with their own wellness team and 
                        a community space where users could find like-minded individuals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the competitor analysis, we created a value proposition matrix to find a place for our product in the market. Most of our 
                        competitors were using a subscription model, and with so many subscription services out there, we didn't want to saddle our 
                        users with yet another subscription. We also wanted to create something that was more accessible and easy-to-use.

                        At this point, we had enough information to start defining and ideating. We decided to start by defining the problem and 
                        hypothesizing a solution. The problem is that people are typically unaware of their mood, which causes them to go through life 
                        being numb to what they are feeling and unable to process it. We hypothesized that by tracking their moods and possible contributing 
                        factors, users can use that data to better understand their feelings and better process them.

                        Meet Aubrie. Aubrie is a yoga instructor and a mother to a 2-year old. Aubrie takes her mental health very seriously. She loves 
                        to meditate and write out her thoughts but often doesn't have the time throughout the day. Aubrie needs a simple online mood 
                        tracking solution that she can fill out at any time.

                        We created a user flow with simplicity in mind. We wanted it to be easy for users to hop onto the website, log an entry, 
                        and carry on with their day. We also wanted users to be able to check their analytics and view the history of their entries. 
                        We also designed the style guide with different color themes in mind, as well as a light and dark mode. We picked out different 
                        emojies and icons to use that we thought would accurately convey different emotions to our users.

                        The first step here was creating a low-fi wireframe to decide how we wanted to structure the website. It helped us to figure out 
                        which elements we would need in our design and how to incorporate them into the layout.

                    <img src="images/moodchart/Mood Entry - Wireframe.png">
                    <p>
                        After this, we moved on to creating a hi-fi 
                        prototype. We added a color theme, icons and graphs, and inputs for tracking mood.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/moodchart/Mood Entry - Prototype.png">
                    <p>
                        Once we finished the hi-fi prototype, we conducted usability tests. We assigned testers with three tasks: Enter a new mood, view 
                        mood entry history, and view account information. We had a 100% success rate with the last two, and a 92% success rate with the 
                        first task. This meant our design was intuitive enough that users could easily perform the basic functions.

                        Once we tested our design, we could move on to development. I was in charge of most of the development on this project. We used 
                        github for the repository, and bootstrap for most of the components. We decided on a file structure and organized everything in a 
                        way that made development go smoothly. Once we set that up, I made 4 pages and built them out based on our design. There 
                        were a few minor things that had to be changed since we were using bootstrap, but we remained faithful to the original design.

                        During the process of this project, we built a whole front-end product in 3 weeks. It was equal parts rewarding and challenging. 
                        By designing and developing this website, I came to fully understand the importance of cultivating awareness of ones mood. 
                        Awareness is the first step in creating any change, and for people who are unhappy with their current life, this site will bring 
                        users awareness and allow them to change.
